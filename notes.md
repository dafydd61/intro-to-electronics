## Resources

## Basic electronics

### Parts

- What's in the kit?

### Ohm’s law

### Kirchoff

### Basic theory

- Circuits
- Electrons
- Turn something on & off: LED, motor. Why not speaker?

## 555 Timer

- Slow blinking LED
    + C = 10µF
    + R1 = 100K
    + R2 = 1K
- Slow blinking LED w/FSR
    + C = 10µF
    + R1 = FSR/100K
    + R2 = 10K
- Speaker
    + C = 1µF
    + R1 = 10K/FSR
    + R2 = 1K
    + Use 10µF cap and 150Ω resistor on speaker
- Motor/Speaker
    + Think about R1 & R2 like a voltage divider
    + C = 1µF
    + Start with pot:
        * R1 < R2 (left) = Slower
        *
